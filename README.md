#History of pixy

Originally inspired by the creator owned comic book explosion in the 90s I started creating my own characters and drawing my own comics. In my early twenties I seriously considered self publishing my stories. I've created a million different scenarios for my characters and a million different versions of the world. Sadly I don't have time to build these out and create the proper stories they deserve. Inspired by the Jenny Everywhere project I've decided to donate my characters to the world.
